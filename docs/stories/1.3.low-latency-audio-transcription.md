# Story 1.3: Low-Latency Audio Transcription

## Status
- Done

## Story
**As a** Magician-Developer, **I want** the captured audio to be transcribed into text with the lowest possible latency, **so that** the AI can respond in near real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `voice_to_text.py` module successfully integrates with a speech recognition library to process the captured audio.
2. The transcription service provider (e.g., OpenAI Whisper or a lower-latency alternative) shall be configurable in `config.yaml`.
3. The implementation must prioritize low latency by investigating and potentially implementing real-time audio streaming to the transcription service, as an alternative to sending a completed audio file.
4. The resulting text transcript is successfully returned to the `main.py` event loop.
5. The full transcript is printed to the console for verification.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement transcription in `src/services/voice_to_text.py` (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Add `async transcribe(buffer: bytes, *, streaming: bool=False) -> str`
  - [x] Support non-streaming; streaming TBD
  - [x] Use `httpx` for API calls if using OpenAI endpoints [Source: docs/architecture.md#3. Tech Stack]
  - [x] Ensure minimal buffering/encoding overhead for low latency [Source: docs/architecture.md#2. High Level Architecture]
- [x] Provider configurability (AC: 2)
  - [x] Extend `corindagpt/config/config.yaml` with `transcription: { provider, model(s), streaming_enabled }`
  - [x] Read provider settings via existing initialization loader [Source: docs/architecture.md#5. Components]
  - [x] Fail with clear error if provider is unsupported; document defaults
- [x] Streaming strategy (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Deferred: Investigate chunked streaming vs full-file implemented under new story (no streaming in ElevenLabs STT; OpenAI Realtime is separate API)
  - [ ] Deferred: Define chunk size, sample rate, and encoding (tracked in follow-on streaming story)
  - [ ] Deferred: Handle partial results aggregation (tracked in follow-on streaming story)
- [x] Integrate with main loop (AC: 4–5)
  - [x] After audio capture completes, call `voice_to_text.transcribe(...)` and await transcript
  - [x] Return transcript to `src/__main__.py` and log the full transcript via `logging`
- [x] Benchmark mode (latency + fidelity)
  - [x] Add BENCHMARK_TRANSCRIPTION=1 to run OpenAI Whisper, OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe, and ElevenLabs in parallel
  - [x] Log per-provider latency (ms) and output text

## Dev Notes

- File Locations
  - Transcription implementation: `src/services/voice_to_text.py` [Source: docs/architecture.md#10. Source Tree]
  - Entry point: `src/__main__.py` [Source: docs/architecture.md#10. Source Tree]

- Technology & External APIs
  - OpenAI Audio Transcriptions API
  - ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text (`scribe_v1`) with diarization and audio event tagging

- Architecture & Performance
  - Fully asynchronous, non-blocking operations throughout
  - Press/hold capture via `SDPressHoldRecorder`; fixed 16 kHz, 16-bit mono WAV

- Benchmark Results (sample)
  - elevenlabs: ~700–950 ms, accurate
  - gpt-4o-transcribe: ~1.5–3.1 s, accurate
  - whisper-1: ~2.5–3.6 s, accurate

- Next (optional)
  - Make ElevenLabs default provider in `config.yaml`
  - Implement streaming transcription path

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes List
- Default provider set to ElevenLabs (`scribe_v1`) for lowest latency and high accuracy
- OpenAI Whisper and gpt-4o-transcribe supported; benchmark mode compares latency and output
- Recorder stabilized with SD-based capture; consistent 16 kHz mono WAV; min-hold and flush reduce short-capture errors
- Streaming investigated; implementation deferred to a follow-on story due to strong batch latency from ElevenLabs and added complexity of Realtime integration

### QA Results
- Manual: Verified capture, transcript logging, and benchmark outputs in console
- Sample runs show ElevenLabs fastest final result with accurate transcripts
